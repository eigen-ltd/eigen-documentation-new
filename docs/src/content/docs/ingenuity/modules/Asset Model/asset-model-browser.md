# 1 An Introduction to Knowledge Graphs Asset Models in Ingenuity 7

Ingenuity is Eigen's digital platform for Engineering and Industrial
Operations. It is built by Engineers, for Engineering and Asset Managers
to make working with data a joy. The Ingenuity platform was first
written in 2009 and now, 15 years on, Ingenuity 7 is a major new
release; a complete re-write from the ground up to include the latest
and best technology and incorporate all the learnings we have from over
17 years deploying digital capability for Oil & Gas, Energy, Chemicals
and Manufacturing industries. It's faster, more secure and more
intuitive than ever before.

There is a publicly accessible demo of Ingenuity 7 available at
<https://ingenuity-sandbox.eigen.co/>

## 1.1 What is Ingenuity

Eigen Ingenuity is a digital platform for getting value from data,
improving decision making and automating labour intensive work
processes.

It is a layer on top of existing systems and makes it easy to combine,
visualise, publicise and share information from existing systems through
online charts, dashboards, reports and automate workflows.

There is no requirement to copy data to a data lake or replace the
underlying systems. It is also system agnostic, so it is easy to roll
out its capability across sites with different systems.

### 1.2 What is a Knowledge Graph?

A Knowledge Graph (KG) is a structured representation of information
that showcases relationships between different entities, typically in a
way that reflects the real world. A KG consists of Nodes and
Relationships (sometime called Edges), where a Node represents a things
like people, places, equipment (can be real or conceptual), and
Relationships are how two Nodes are related e.g. "is a friend of," "is
part of," "located in." 

It can be useful to think of a Node as a
'thing,' and a relationship as an action. There is no limit to the
number of relationships a node can have. Generally, they are optimised
to make searches like "Find all the things located in A that are part of
thing B" very fast.

### 1.3 Knowledge Graphs in Ingenuity

Ingenuity supports the Neo4j graph database out of the box, but it is
possible to connect other KGs if required.

:::caution[Note]
The rest of this document assumes that Ingenuity contains a Neo4j graph
database.

### 1.4 Accessing the Knowledge Graph

To access the Knowledge Graph in Ingenuity, simple click on 'Knowledge
Graph' in the left-hand menu.

This displays the standard Neo4j browser interface. For more details on
using this browser, see [Neo4j Browser Manual](https://neo4j.com/docs/browser-manual/current)

### 1.5 What is an Asset Model?

An asset model is a data model that represents asset components such as
wells, pipelines, manifolds, separator, pumps or compressors. It also
holds important facts about those assets such as key properties and
relationships with references to these assets in other systems, such as
timeseries data, blueprints, documents, work orders and risk
assessments. Assets can also be related to each other such as when wells
are connected to a manifold or valves connected to vessels.

Asset models have been implemented using various technologies throughout
time: relational databases, object-oriented databases and more recently
graph databases.

Asset models are important in the digitalisation of processes because
they enable the creation of generic visuals (also called templated
displays), the scale up of automated workflows across many assets of the
same type and allow the calculation of roll-up summaries.

**In Ingenuity 7, Asset Models are created using Knowledge Graphs.**

Users can browse the Knowledge Graph directly (See the chapter on
Knowledge Graphs) but can also navigate the model using the Asset Model
Browser, which is explained in this chapter.

# 2 Asset Model Browser

## 2.1 Accessing the Asset Model Browser

To access the Asset Model Browser in Ingenuity, simply click on ''Asset
Mode' icon in the left-hand menu.

This calls up a blank Asset Model page (or the last Asset browsed, if
used before).

### 2.2 Browsing Assets (Objects)

To start, type the name of any asset in your asset model. As you type,
the system will search the asset model and return all Assets matching
(case insensitive) the text entered, e.g. in this example, we typed
"well"

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/asset-model-browser/image7.png)

Selecting an Asset from the list of search results will set this Asset
as the top object in the left-hand panel. Selecting this Asset will
display object properties (attributes) on the right side as shown in the
diagram below.

Object labels are shown as tags with a blue background.

:::tip

_Labels are used to identify an objects "type" or "class". An object will
usually have multiple labels that reflect the class hierarchy._

_For example, a Boeing 747 could be classified as an "Aeroplane", an
"Airliner", a "PassengerJet" or a "Boeing747"._

:::

### 2.3 Related objects

Clicking the "\>" icon to the left of the Asset will expand the list of
relationship to and from this object.

Clicking the "\>" icon to the left of the relationship will expand the
list of Objects connected by this relationship type.

For example, by expanding the "hashistoriantag" relationship, we see all
the historian tag objects. Clicking on one of these HistorianTag
objects, we can see it's properties and a sparkline of the data in the
right hand panel, as shown below.

Note the attribute "measurementName": This is the generic name of the
measurement which can be used to generalise references for the purpose
of workflows and visualisation artifacts.

Other entries, such as "is_a" and "is_in" show relationships of the
current object with others in the model. This is example, the well "is
a" PCP Well and "is in" STN_01 (Station 01).
